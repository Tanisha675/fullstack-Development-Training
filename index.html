    <h2>How to Stay Consistent with Your Goals</h2>
    <p>Staying consistent with your goals is not about motivation; it’s about building a system that works for you.
        Motivation comes and goes, but discipline and routine are what keep you going. Start by setting small and clear
        goals instead of big, vague ones. Break your main goal into tiny daily tasks — something so easy that you can’t
        skip it. Track your progress in a journal or app; even ticking a box can boost your confidence. Celebrate small
        wins, no matter how silly they feel. And yes, expect bad days — just don’t let one bad day turn into a bad week.
        Surround yourself with people or content that inspires you, and avoid distractions that pull you off-track. Most
        importantly, remind yourself why you started in the first place. Your reason should be stronger than your
        excuses. Consistency doesn’t mean being perfect — it means showing up even when it’s hard. Over time, your small
        efforts become habits, and those habits shape your success.

    <h2>Daily Habits That Changed My Life</h2>
    <p>Life doesn’t change overnight, but small daily habits can truly transform it over time. I used to be stuck in a
        loop — unmotivated, disorganized, and constantly tired. Then I started focusing on simple daily actions. Waking
        up early gave me mental peace and extra time for myself. I began journaling for 5 minutes every morning, which
        helped clear my mind. Reading just 10 pages a day introduced me to new perspectives I never imagined. I also
        made a habit of walking or doing light stretching for 20 minutes — it boosted my energy more than caffeine ever
        could. Limiting screen time before bed improved my sleep quality drastically. Most importantly, I started
        practicing gratitude every night — writing down just 3 good things about the day. These small habits didn’t feel
        magical at first, but slowly, they rewired my mindset and increased my focus. It’s the consistency that made the
        real difference. Now, I feel more aligned, positive, and driven than ever before.
